# 🔒 ZK-Flash Arbitrage Token ($ZKARB)

A high-speed, privacy-preserving arbitrage protocol built on Solana and powered by ZK-SNARKs. `$ZKARB` is designed to enable efficient, front-running-resistant arbitrage execution across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with built-in incentives for stakers and liquidity providers.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**$ZKARB** allows traders to perform **private, high-frequency arbitrage** using a novel token and protocol structure that:
- Rewards stakers and LPs based on arbitrage earnings.
- Leverages **ZK-SNARKs** to hide trade details until after settlement.
- Prevents MEV and sandwich attacks via randomized execution delays.
- Dynamically adjusts fees and liquidity based on network state and pool conditions.
