# 🔒 ZK-Flash Arbitrage Token ($ZKARB)

A high-speed, privacy-preserving arbitrage protocol built on Solana and powered by ZK-SNARKs. `$ZKARB` is designed to enable efficient, front-running-resistant arbitrage execution across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with built-in incentives for stakers and liquidity providers.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**$ZKARB** allows traders to perform **private, high-frequency arbitrage** using a novel token and protocol structure that:
- Rewards stakers and LPs based on arbitrage earnings.
- Leverages **ZK-SNARKs** to hide trade details until after settlement.
- Prevents MEV and sandwich attacks via randomized execution delays.
- Dynamically adjusts fees and liquidity based on network state and pool conditions.

|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💸 Staking Rewards                 | Users stake $ZKARB to access arbitrage pools and earn profits.             |
| 🛡️ ZK Privacy                     | Arbitrage trades use ZK-SNARKs to hide price differentials and routes.     |
| 🚀 Slippage Protection            | Trades must meet minimum profit targets before executing.                  |
| 💰 Profit Sharing                 | Rewards distributed to stakers and LPs proportionally.                     |
| 🔒 Flash Loan Protection          | Temporary staking lockup to prevent exploit-based withdrawals.             |
| ♻️ Liquidity Rebalancing         | Pools are dynamically balanced across AMMs.                                |
| 📊 Dynamic Fees                  | Protocol fees adjust based on Solana’s current fee model.                  |
| 🧨 MEV-Resistant                 | Uses randomized delays to avoid sandwich attacks and frontrunning.         |
| 🔥 Fee Burning                   | A portion of the protocol fees are burned to increase scarcity.            |
